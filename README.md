# react-setup

An attempt at a light-weight, barebones react/webpack setup, with an additional focus on build size.

## Tech Considerations:
- React w/ ES6
- JSX
- Babel
- Webpack 3

## Things to do/consider:
- Add JS minifier that supports ES6. Current use of `UglifyJsPlugin` does not fully support ES6. Considering `babel/minify` (aka Babili?)
